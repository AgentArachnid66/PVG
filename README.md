So this is a technical demo for a VR game I have been working on. It will be available to work with Vive and Oculus and I'll try to implement Leap Motion support as well.

Main Idea

You've landed on a distant planet looking for valuable materials. The surface is too hostile for you to go out and collect it yourself, so you pilot around a drone to do it for you. Bring back the precious items and exchange them for money to upgrade your gear.
