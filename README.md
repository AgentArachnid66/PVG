So this is a technical demo for a VR game I have been working on. It will be available to work with Vive and Oculus and I'll try to implement Leap Motion support as well.

Main Idea

You've landed on a distant planet looking for valuable materials. The surface is too hostile for you to go out and collect it yourself, so you pilot around a drone to do it for you. Bring back the precious items and exchange them for money to upgrade your gear.

Started to implement the player inventory system and got a basic speech commands working. Full details are in the commit I pushed today.

To Do
- Implement the drone's transmission limit (how far away from the base it can go before it starts to slow down and eventually stop)
- Implement the drone's battery (how long it can go between charging)
- Implement basic upgrades (increase transmission limit, battery, etc)
- Draw out the map and then implement in Unity
- Basic UI for the inventory
